# John-Brawn
'The Zombie Defense Contractor'

The zombie apocalypse has struck, and society has barely managed to hold on. 
In the completely crashed economy, only one sector is growing... defense contracting.
You play as ex-marine John Brawn, founder of John Brawn's Zombie Defense Co.
In this tower defense game, cities hire you to protect them from outbreaks of zombieism, and as your reputation grows so does the stature of the cities you are hired to defend.

Extremely WIP Unity project between friends
